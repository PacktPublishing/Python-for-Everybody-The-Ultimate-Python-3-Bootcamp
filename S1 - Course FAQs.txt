Installing Python
Installing Python should be very straightforward. But on some computers (depending on the operating system and pre-existing programs) this could be a little more difficult.

Go to Python.org and download the latest version of Python. Then install the program like you would normally install any program.

Open your command line program (most likely one of these: Command Prompt, Terminal, Bash, etc)

Type python -V to see your version of Python

Note: if you are on Windows and you can a permission error, try using py -V and instead of executing a file with python yourfile.py, use py yourfile.py

Common Questions:
Do I need Jupyter, Notebook and Anaconda for this course?
No, you do not. It just makes writing Python a little easier and a little nicer. To execute any of the .ipynb files you'll need Jupyter Notebook installed, but those are optional regardless as you can read the file output on GitHub.
